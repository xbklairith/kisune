# Spec-Driven Implementation Skill

## Purpose

Guide feature implementation through two structured phases: Task Breakdown (TDD) → Execution. This systematic approach ensures test-driven development, quality gates, and tracked progress from design to working code.

## Activation Triggers

Activate this skill when:
- User says "implement this feature" or "let's code this"
- User mentions "tasks", "TDD", or "execution"
- User uses `/dev-workflow:spec` command with implementation options (tasks, execute)
- User is ready to start implementation after design approval
- User says "break this down into tasks"
- Design phase is complete and approved

## Prerequisites

This skill requires completed planning from `spec-driven-planning` skill:
- [ ] Feature directory exists: `docx/features/[NN-feature-name]/`
- [ ] `requirements.md` is complete with EARS requirements
- [ ] `design.md` is complete and approved

**If prerequisites are missing:**
> "Implementation requires completed planning. Run `/dev-workflow:spec` and complete options 1-3 first (Feature Creation, Requirements, Design)."

---

## Two-Phase Implementation Workflow

### Phase 4: Task Breakdown (TDD Focus)

**Goal:** Break design into small, testable tasks following Red-Green-Refactor

**Task Structure:**

Each task follows TDD cycle:
```
[ ] Task N: [Description]
    [ ] RED: Write failing test for [functionality]
    [ ] GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass test
    [ ] REFACTOR: Clean up and optimize

    Acceptance Criteria:
    [ ] [Specific criterion 1]
    [ ] [Specific criterion 2]
```

**Task Sizing Guidelines:**
- Each task should take 30-60 minutes
- If longer, break into subtasks
- Each task must be independently testable
- Each task produces working, tested code

**Task Categories:**

1. **Component Tasks**
   - Implement individual components
   - One component per task or split if large

2. **Integration Tasks**
   - Connect components
   - Test component interactions
   - Verify data flow

3. **Error Handling Tasks**
   - Implement error scenarios
   - Test edge cases
   - Verify error messages

4. **Documentation Tasks**
   - Write docstrings
   - Update README
   - Create API docs

5. **Final Verification Tasks**
   - Code review
   - Performance testing
   - Security review
   - Manual testing

**Output:**
Update `docx/features/[NN-feature-name]/tasks.md` with:
- Implementation approach summary
- Organized task list with checkboxes
- Acceptance criteria for each task
- Notes section for implementation considerations

**User Confirmation:**
> "Tasks defined with TDD cycle. Ready to begin implementation?"

---

### Phase 5: Execution

**Goal:** Execute tasks systematically with quality gates

**Execution Workflow:**

For each task:

1. **Mark Task as In Progress**

   **Use Edit tool** on `docx/features/[NN-feature-name]/tasks.md`:

   - Find the task header: `[ ] Task N: [description]`
   - Replace with: `[→] Task N: [description]`
   - Also mark the RED phase checkbox as `[→]`

   **Example Edit call:**
   ```
   Edit tool:
     file: docx/features/01-user-auth/tasks.md
     old_string: "[ ] Task 3: Implement JWT validation"
     new_string: "[→] Task 3: Implement JWT validation"
   ```

2. **RED Phase**

   - Write failing test for the specific functionality
   - Run test suite to verify failure (test MUST fail)
   - **Use Edit tool** to check off RED phase: `[ ] RED: ...` → `[x] RED: ...`
   - Commit: `test: Add test for [functionality]`

3. **GREEN Phase**

   - Write minimal implementation to make test pass
   - Run tests until passing (all tests MUST pass)
   - Don't optimize yet (just make it work)
   - **Use Edit tool** to check off GREEN phase: `[ ] GREEN: ...` → `[x] GREEN: ...`
   - Commit: `feat: Implement [functionality]`

4. **REFACTOR Phase**

   - Clean up code (remove duplication, improve naming)
   - Run tests to ensure still passing
   - **Use Edit tool** to check off REFACTOR phase: `[ ] REFACTOR: ...` → `[x] REFACTOR: ...`
   - Commit: `refactor: Optimize [component]`

5. **Mark Task Complete**

   **Use Edit tool** on `docx/features/[NN-feature-name]/tasks.md`:

   - Change task header: `[→] Task N: ...` → `[x] Task N: ...`
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are checked: `[x]`
   - Update Progress Summary section (see instructions below)

### Task Tracking Protocol

**CRITICAL: Use Edit tool to update tasks.md - don't just announce progress.**

#### Workflow Summary

```
Start Phase 5
    ↓
Edit: Status "Not Started" → "In Progress"
    ↓
For each task:
    ↓
    Edit: [ ] Task N → [→] Task N
    Edit: [ ] RED → [→] RED
    ↓
    Write failing test
    ↓
    Edit: [→] RED → [x] RED
    Edit: [ ] GREEN → [→] GREEN
    ↓
    Implement code
    ↓
    Edit: [→] GREEN → [x] GREEN
    Edit: [ ] REFACTOR → [→] REFACTOR
    ↓
    Refactor code
    ↓
    Edit: [→] REFACTOR → [x] REFACTOR
    Edit: [→] Task N → [x] Task N
    Edit: Update Progress Summary
    ↓
Next task or finish
    ↓
Edit: Status "In Progress" → "Complete"
```

#### Edit Tool Usage Pattern

**Always follow this pattern for every task:**

1. **Before starting any task:**
   ```
   Use Edit tool to change [ ] → [→] in tasks.md
   ```

2. **After completing each phase (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR):**
   ```
   Use Edit tool to change [→] → [x] for that phase
   Use Edit tool to change [ ] → [→] for next phase
   ```

3. **After completing full task:**
   ```
   Use Edit tool to change [→] → [x] for task header
   Use Edit tool to update Progress Summary counts
   ```

4. **Don't skip these Edit calls** - they're not optional suggestions, they're required operations.

#### Announcing vs. Modifying

**Wrong (Just Announcing):**
```
✅ Task 1 complete
Moving to Task 2...
```

**Right (Actually Modifying + Announcing):**
```
[Using Edit tool to mark Task 1 complete: [→] → [x]]
[Using Edit tool to update Progress Summary: Completed 1/10]
✅ Task 1 complete

[Using Edit tool to mark Task 2 in progress: [ ] → [→]]
Starting Task 2: JWT token generation...
```

#### Progress Summary Maintenance

The Progress Summary section must stay synchronized:

**Before any tasks start:**
```markdown
- Total Tasks: 10
- Completed: 0/10
- In Progress: None
```

**After Task 1 starts:**
```markdown
- Total Tasks: 10
- Completed: 0/10
- In Progress: Task 1 - User model with password hashing
```

**After Task 1 completes:**
```markdown
- Total Tasks: 10
- Completed: 1/10
- In Progress: Task 2 - JWT token generation
```

**Use Edit tool** to update these fields after every task completion.

---

**Status Checkpoints:**

Every 2-3 completed tasks, provide status update:

```
🔄 Checkpoint Update:
- ✅ Tests: [N/N] passing
- ✅ Type check: No errors
- ✅ Lint: Clean
- 📝 Completed tasks: [X/Y]
- 🎯 Next: [Next task description]

[Confidence: X.X]
```

---

### Quick Reference

**Edit patterns already detailed above. Key reminders:**
- Update Status header when starting/completing implementation
- Use Grep to count tasks if needed: `grep -c "^\- \[x\] Task" tasks.md`
- Update test coverage optionally: Run `npm run test:coverage` and Edit tasks.md

---

**Auto-Trigger Code Quality Review:**

Before each commit:
- Auto-activate `code-quality` skill
- Review changes for issues
- Address critical findings before commit

**Integration Points:**

- Activate `test-driven-development` skill for strict TDD guidance
- Use `git-workflow` skill for smart commits
- Use `code-quality` skill for pre-commit reviews

**Completion Criteria:**

Feature is complete when:
- [ ] All tasks checked off
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] No type errors
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Manual testing complete

**Final Output:**
```
✅ Feature Complete: [Feature Name]

Summary:
- Total tasks: [N]
- Tests added: [N]
- Test coverage: [X%]
- Commits: [N]
- Files changed: [N]

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Principles

### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

**RED (Write Failing Test):**
```
Write a test that describes what the code should do.
The test MUST fail because the code doesn't exist yet.
This proves the test is actually testing something.
```

**GREEN (Make Test Pass):**
```
Write the MINIMUM code needed to make the test pass.
Don't worry about elegance or optimization.
Just make it work.
```

**REFACTOR (Improve Code):**
```
Now that tests pass, improve the code:
- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Simplify logic
- Optimize performance
Run tests after each change to ensure they still pass.
```

### TDD Best Practices

**DO:**
- Write test before production code (always RED first)
- Write smallest test possible
- Run tests frequently
- Commit at each phase (RED, GREEN, REFACTOR)
- Keep tests fast and independent

**DON'T:**
- Write production code without a failing test
- Write multiple tests before implementation
- Skip the refactor phase
- Test implementation details (test behavior)
- Let tests become slow or flaky

## Back to Planning

If during implementation you discover:
- Missing requirements
- Design needs changes
- Unclear specifications

**STOP implementation and return to planning:**
> "Implementation blocked: [issue]. Need to revisit [requirements/design]. Use `/dev-workflow:spec [requirements/design]` to update planning documents."

Then use `spec-driven-planning` skill to update planning documents before continuing implementation.

---

## Notes

### Critical Requirements

- **NEVER write production code without a failing test first**
- **ALWAYS use Edit tool to update tasks.md checkboxes** - don't just announce progress
- **ALWAYS use Edit tool to update Progress Summary** after each task completion
- **Use Edit tool to update Status header** when starting/completing implementation

### Task Tracking Best Practices

- **Mark in progress:** Use Edit tool to change `[ ]` → `[→]` before starting task
- **Mark complete:** Use Edit tool to change `[→]` → `[x]` after finishing task
- **Update Progress Summary:** Use Edit tool after every task to keep counts accurate
- **File updates are mandatory:** Actually modify tasks.md, don't just announce

### Implementation Guidelines

- Provide checkpoint updates every 2-3 tasks
- Auto-trigger code-quality before commits
- Use git-workflow skill for smart commit messages
- Follow TDD cycle religiously (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Stop and return to planning if design issues discovered

### Remember

**Announcing progress ≠ Updating files**

Wrong:
```
✅ Task 1 complete
Moving to Task 2...
```

Right:
```
[Using Edit tool to mark Task 1 complete: [→] → [x]]
[Using Edit tool to update Progress Summary]
✅ Task 1 complete
```
