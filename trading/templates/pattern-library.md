# Pattern Entries

## Breakout Retest

**Win Rate:** 15W-8L = 65%
**Average R:R:** 2.5:1
**Best Markets:** BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SPY
**Best Timeframes:** 4H, Daily
**Last Updated:** [Date]

---

### Pattern Description

Price breaks above a key resistance level with volume, then pulls back to retest the broken level as new support. The retest holds (doesn't break back below), and price continues upward.

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Clear resistance level tested multiple times
- Sharp breakout with volume spike
- Pullback to broken level (ideally on lower volume)
- Hold at broken level (candlestick confirmation)
- Continuation upward

---

### Setup Criteria

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Clear resistance identified (minimum 2-3 prior touches)
- [ ] Higher timeframe trend is bullish (price above 200 MA on HTF)
- [ ] No major news events in next 24 hours

**Pattern Requirements:**
- [ ] Breakout above resistance with volume >1.5x average
- [ ] Price pulls back to broken resistance within 5-10 candles
- [ ] Retest volume is lower than breakout volume
- [ ] Price holds above broken level (candle closes above)
- [ ] Bullish candle pattern at retest (e.g., hammer, bullish engulfing)

**Confirmation:**
- [ ] Small bounce from retested level (2-3% minimum)
- [ ] Volume picks up slightly on bounce

---

### Entry Rules

**Entry Trigger:**
Price bounces from retested level with bullish candlestick confirmation

**Entry Types:**
1. **Aggressive:** Enter on breakout (before retest) - Not recommended, lower win rate
2. **Conservative:** Enter after retest holds and bounce begins (preferred)
3. **Confirmation:** Enter when price breaks above high of bounce candle

**Preferred Entry:**
Conservative entry after retest holds. Wait for bullish candle close above retested level, then enter on next candle open or on break above bounce candle high.

---

### Stop Loss Placement

**Primary Stop:**
Below the low of the retest candle (usually 1-2% below entry)

**Secondary Stop:**
If retest candle low is too far, use 2x ATR below entry

**Maximum Risk:**
1% of account per trade

---

### Profit Targets

**Target 1:** Next resistance level or 1:2 R:R - 50% position
**Target 2:** Measured move (prior range) or 1:3 R:R - 30% position
**Target 3:** Major resistance above or 1:5 R:R - 20% position

**Measured Move:**
Distance from bottom of range to resistance, projected upward from breakout point

**Trailing Stop:**
After T1 hit, move stop to breakeven. After T2 hit, trail stop at 1x ATR below price.

---

### Invalidation

**Pattern Fails If:**
- Price breaks back below the retested level (close below, not just a wick)
- Retest never occurs (price runs away after breakout - missed opportunity)
- Retest happens on very high volume (suggests breakdown, not retest)

**Action on Invalidation:**
Exit immediately if price closes below retested level. This often leads to reversal back into prior range.

---

### Best Conditions

**Market State:**
Trending markets with clear momentum. Works in both bull and bear markets (inverted for shorts).

**Time of Day:**
Best during high liquidity hours (US session for stocks, any time for crypto)

**Timeframe:**
Most reliable on 4H and Daily charts. Works on 1H but more noise/false signals.

**Volatility:**
Medium to high volatility (ATR >1% of price). Low volatility retests tend to fail more often.

---

### Personal Notes

**Strengths:**
- High win rate when all criteria met
- Clear risk/reward with defined levels
- Works across all markets and timeframes
- Easy to identify and execute

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires patience (waiting for retest instead of chasing breakout)
- Sometimes retest doesn't occur (missed trades)
- Can fail in low liquidity conditions (wicks through level)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always wait for retest - aggressive entries on breakout have 30% lower win rate
- Volume confirmation is critical - high volume retests often fail
- Works better when HTF trend aligned (daily trend up for bullish setups)
- Don't force it - if retest doesn't set up cleanly, skip the trade

### Trade Examples

#### Winning Trade Example 1
- **Date:** 2024-01-10
- **Instrument:** BTC/USDT
- **Entry:** $42,500 (after retest of $42,000 resistance)
- **Stop:** $41,800 (below retest low)
- **Exit:** $44,800 (T2)
- **P/L:** +$2,300 (+5.4%)
- **R:R:** 3.2:1
- **Lesson:** Perfect setup - breakout on volume, retest on low volume, bounce with volume pickup. Patience rewarded.

#### Winning Trade Example 2
- **Date:** 2024-01-05
- **Instrument:** SPY
- **Entry:** $478.50
- **Stop:** $476.20
- **Exit:** $483.10 (T1 and T2)
- **P/L:** +$4.60 (+0.96%)
- **R:R:** 2.0:1
- **Lesson:** Clean daily chart setup, held perfectly at retest.

#### Losing Trade Example 1
- **Date:** 2024-01-03
- **Instrument:** ETH/USDT
- **Entry:** $2,280
- **Stop:** $2,250
- **Exit:** $2,248 (stopped out)
- **P/L:** -$32 (-1.4%)
- **Lesson:** Retest occurred on higher volume than breakout - should have recognized this as a warning sign. Don't ignore volume divergence.
